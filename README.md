## About the Project

Managing hundreds or even thousands of job applications across several job search portals is cumbersome, but JobBuddy makes this process a breeze by allowing users to efficiently visualize and organize the listings they don't want to or still need to action on.

This product at its core is a Google Chrome extension connected with a Next.js API and PostgreSQL database, which allows for not only an organized view on the JobBuddy dashboard, but also right from each of the job boards that are supported.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js v14+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [PostgreSQL 11+](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installing

To start, compile and build out the Chrome extension's content scripts by running the following command from the project's root directory: ```npm run dev```.

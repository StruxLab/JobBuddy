# JobBuddy BETA
JobBuddy is a cross-platform application that assists jobseekers in tracking job postings that individuals are interested in and/or have applied to.

## The Problem
The job search is hard enough, but how do you manage parsing through thousands of job postings? Did you consider this posting already? This one looks interesting, but also familiar- have you applied to it yet? Does this process have to be so manual?\
\
That's where JobBuddy comes in! JobBuddy integrates with the interfaces of some of the most popular job searching portals to keep you focused on the jobs you haven't applied to yet, so you can come to quicker decisions on whether you should spend your time applying to them.
